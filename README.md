# Modern Foreign Languages

This repository contains a server which hosts material to aid in the teaching of various foreign langauges: Italian (02/08/22) and Swedish (06/09/23). This is not intended to be a sole learning resource, nor is an extensive guide, only as my personal notes and support. I am also learning on Duolingo as `TriflicAcid` among other methods.

The server may be started by `npm start` or `node server/main.js [PORT]` and will listen on `http://localhost:[PORT]`. Note that the server is only required for certain pages; other static HTML pages may be viewed without the server being active.

## TODO

- Automatic article generation for a given word (la, le, il, il, l', lo, gli)
