# Languages

This repository contains a server which hosts material to aid in the teaching of various langauges.

- Latin (01/09/2018)
- Italian (02/08/2022)
- Swedish (06/09/2023)

This is not intended to be a sole learning resource, nor is an extensive guide, only as my personal notes and support. For some languages, I am also learning on Duolingo as `TriflicAcid`.

The server may be started by `npm start` or `node server/main.js [PORT]` and will listen on `http://localhost:[PORT]`. Note that the server is only required for certain pages; other static HTML pages may be viewed without the server being active.

## TODO

**Italian**

- Automatic article generation for a given word (la, le, il, il, l', lo, gli)
